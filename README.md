# The Internet
Can I rebuild the internet on a local scale with an eye towards the community?  
## Description
We take internet infrastructure for granted.  Most of us don't understand it, and as such we have no idea how to leverage it.  I'm interested in building rebuilding internet infrastructure from scratch and on a small scale to explore issues about network control and privacy.  Can we distribute information without relying on ISPs, ad networks, and government snoops? Can a network reflect and be controlled by the community where the network lives.  
The goal is to anchor the internet to a physical location. To provide a localized network experience that better reflects the community where the network exists.
## What?
A community network where users can upload "web pages" that are only visible to the local network.  A fully offline system where people can publish content that will be shared with only the people in their network.  the content will be in the form of a webpage and the combined result of its usage will be an intranet full of web pages, complete with URLs, and published by members of the network. 

The network would look and function like any internet hotspot, except all webpages will be hosted locally -- and users can upload their own content.  All current decisions with regard to current internet infrastructure will be reconsidered and refocused to emphasize the community in which it serves ( local DNS lookup maybe distributed storage? ).  This is part activism / part art / all experiment.  A completely open vehicle to upload and distribute content on a local level.
