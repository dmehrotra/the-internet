# The Othernet
Can I rebuild the internet on a local scale with an eye towards the community?  
## Description
We take internet infrastructure for granted.  Most of us don't understand it, and as such we have no idea how to leverage it.  I'm interested in building rebuilding internet infrastructure from scratch and on a small scale to explore issues about network control and privacy.  Can we distribute information without relying on ISPs, ad networks, and government snoops? Can a network reflect and be controlled by the community where the network lives.  
The goal is to anchor the internet to a physical location. To provide a localized network experience that better reflects the community where the network exists.
## What?
The Othernet is a decentralized network experiment that plans to span over 10 blocks in Bed Stuy by June. The goal here is to explore what new types of sharing, intimacy, and trust can emerge in a network built in a context. Once connected to the Othernet you are transported to an alternate vision of the web -- websites here do not exist there, and rules built into the infrastructure turn the physical network into member of the Othernet. This fully offline meshed network consists of a message board, chat, and a simple page builder to allow any neighbor in range of the signal to build a website.  Meetings are held to establish network rules -- do webpages slowly disappear if not visited, do we flag content deemed inappropriate? This is ongoing technical and research project.  Currently one node has been set up at 197 Monroe Street
