# The Internet
Can I rebuild the internet on a local scale with an eye towards the community?  
## Description
We take internet infrastructure for granted.  Most of us don't understand it, and as such we have no idea how to leverage it for activism.  I'm interested in leveraging internet infrastructure to explore issues about network control and privacy.  Can we distribute information without relying on ISPs, ad networks, and government snoops.  
## What?
A community network where users can upload "web pages" that are only visible to the local network.  The network would look and function like any internet hotspot, except all webpages will be hosted locally -- and users can upload their own content.  All current decisions with regard to current internet infrastructure will be reconsidered and refocused to emphasize the community in which it serves ( local DNS lookup maybe distributed storage? ).  This is part activism / part art / all experiment.  A completely open vehicle to upload and distribute content on a local level.
